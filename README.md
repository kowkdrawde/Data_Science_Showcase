# Data-Science-Showcase
A collection of python data science projects covering Health, Finance, and Science.

**Only belly could tell about our body fat?** - Regression Study on Body Fat using [PySpark (new and update)](https://github.com/kowkdrawde/Data_Science_Showcase/blob/master/PySpark_BodyFat.ipynb) /
[sklearn](https://github.com/kowkdrawde/Data_Science_Showcase/blob/master/Regression_Study_on_Body_Fat_Data.ipynb)
**<br>It's a star...it's a galaxy...it's quasar!** - [Classification Study on Stellar Objects](https://github.com/kowkdrawde/Data_Science_Showcase/blob/master/Classification_Study_on_Stellar_Objects.ipynb)
**<br>Banking habits suggest banking credits?** - [Clustering Study on Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/kowkdrawde/Data_Science_Showcase/blob/master/Clustering_Study_on_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb)
**<br>To grade or not to grade, that's the question.** - [Deep Learning Study on Body Performance](https://github.com/kowkdrawde/Data_Science_Showcase/blob/master/Deep_Learning_Study_on_Body_Performance.ipynb)

A summary of the findings in response to the questions is included in the last section of each project.

Each notebook itself starts from analysing data from scratch, followed by step-by-step model building and evluation. Each concludes with a summary. Techniques included:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Wranggling and Visualisation
- Features Selection, Approximation and Engineering
- Modelling:
  <br> Regression - Linear/Ridge/Lasso Regression
  <br> Classification - Logistic Regression/Random Forest/Gradient Boosting, SMOTE and Random Undersampling
  <br> Clustering - KMeans, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN
  <br> Deep Learning - Tensorflow/Keras Dense Layers, Activation Functions and Optimizers 
- Hyperparameter Fine-tuning
- Model Evaluation 
  <br> MSE, Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1score, loss functions: sparse categorical cross-entropy
